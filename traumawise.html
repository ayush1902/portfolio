				<h2 id="intro" style="margin-top: 1.5em;">Introduction</h2>
				<p>As a part of my Master's degree at University of Washington, this project dives into the intricacies of a user-centred design process: hypothesising a design rationale, validating the hypothesis through user research, using user stories and scenarios to inform sketches and ideation, and getting user feedback for low/high fidelity prototypes.
				</p>			
				<h2 id="one">1. Problem</h2>
				<p>The current state of car interfaces is increasingly digital - big bold touch screens that the user can interact with, voice commands, and seamless media transfer from phone to the car. Despite these  advancements, there have been few that address the executive functioning of the user. Returning to driving after a traumatic brain injury (TBI) can be intimidating, especially when every interaction is digital. For this project we wanted to find out what are the main issues faced by TBI survivors while driving, what kind of cues would they be comfortable recieving, and how big of a role does a car interface can play in their driving experience, which narrows our initial design question to -</p>
				<p class="emp">"How can we support brain injury survivors as they return to driving?"</p>
				<h2 id="two">2. User Research</h2>
				<p>Before begining with user research, it was essential to establish who we are designing for. Our primary stakeholders were traumatic brain injury survivors who are returning to driving. Our secondary stakeholders were Occupational Therapists and Speech-Language Pathologists, and also a patient's friend, family member, or caregiver, who may accompany them at different stages of their tasks.
				</p>
				<img src="images/user-research.png" alt="">
				<h3><span class="underline">2.1 Surveys</span></h3>
				<p>We created a survey with 32 questions targeting individuals with TBIs who are currently driving. The survey included questions about a participant’s demographics, medical history, challenges with driving, driving habits, and their suggestions of what could improve their driving experience. There was a combination of short answer responses, long answer responses, and checkboxes, along with additional input for contact information so as to follow them up for interviews.</p>

	                </ul>
            	</div>
				<h3><span class="underline">2.2 Interviews</span></h3>
				<p style="margin-bottom: 1em !important;">The next step was following up with people who provided their contact information in the surveys for interviews. We were able to interview nine TBI survivors, understanding the intricacies of their injury and its repercussions, asking about their personal inventory when they drive, their pain points, and their initial impressions of our design approach. In addition, we also interviewed some of the professionals in the field like a Driving Rehabilitation Specialist, Occupational Therapist, and a Speech Language Pathologist to further gain insight into the details of a brain injury and its effect on cognitive processes. </p>

				<p class="emp" style="margin-bottom: 2.5em;">"You should avoid imposing anything and curating solutions based on responses from indiviual survivors as a suggestion from one could potentially become a distraction for another."

				<h3><span class="underline">2.3 Competitive Product Analysis</span></h3>
				<p>We looked up existing tools or programs that addressed driving safety for individuals with cognitive impairments.</p>
				<img src="images/cpa.png" alt="">
				<h3><span class="underline">2.4 Research Findings</span></h3>
				<ul>
					<li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Playfair Display;">Anxiety</span> - This is a recurring issue with TBI survivors, however, they are not necessarily anxious about their skills as a driver. Some cannot articulate their source of their anxiety - being in a car is enough of a cause. Many cited memory and distractions as causes and often, anxiety led to fatigue or frustration. </li>
					<li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Playfair Display;">Memory</span> - While their ability to drive is unaffected, some experienced forgetfulness as related to driving specifically (e.g. forgetting to check their blind spot or for traffic before making a right turn at a stop light); others forget generic tasks (e.g. an intended destination or purpose for being there)</li>
					<li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Playfair Display;">Distractability</span> - For TBI survivors, anything can become a distraction, inside or outside of the car, moving or stationary. As a result, their reasons for distractions are highly individualized.</li>
					<li style="margin-bottom: 2.5em;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Playfair Display;">Independence</span> - When asked why driving was important, “independence” was repeatedly a top hit. This not only confirmed the second part of our design rationale but also helped us understand the conflict TBI survivors are experiencing as they re-enter their lives.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h3><span class="underline">2.5 Design Requirements</span></h3>
				<p>Based on our research findings, we found a recurring theme that popped out from the interviews; i.e. individualized. Instead of giving users a set of options, it was essential to give them the freedom to customize according to their comfort. This helped us further scope down the original design question to:</p>
				<p class="emp">"How can we support traumatic brain injury survivors by reducing their cognitive load as they return to driving?"</p>

            	<p>To address the varying degrees of need from our users at the same time being wary of the fact that a possible solution for one user could be a major distractions for another, we structured most of our design features in the heart of the Settings view of the application. This would allow each user to customize everything - from the frequency and and type of reminders/cues, goals, and breaks - according to their needs.</p>

            		<p> The car infotainment system would work in tandem with the smartphone/wearable application - the smartphone application would keep a track of the sleeping habits, heart rate and based on that data it would seamlessly synchronize to the dashboard interface and alert the user if any of the above mentioned executive function levels are below the optimal. We tried to reduce the cognitive load as the driver has to interact with a singular interface in a particular context, thereby reducing the need to interact with other mobile/wearable interfaces.</p>

            	<p>After having some initial ideas about what goes in the application, we deicided to bring that to life by making a paper prototype, coupled with a scenario. The scenario was predominantly fixed to give context to non-TBI participants and also to get an initial hint of whether the users are able to perform atleast one task that they know beforehand. The scenario was as follows:</p>

				<h3><span class="underline">4.2 Usability Test Results</span></h3>
				<p>With the constraint of time along with having such a niche target audience, the usability testing had a sample size of only 5 participants. However, the feedback garnered from the testing was very insightful and helped us look at the project from a totally different perspective:</p>
				<p class="emp">1. "How intrusive are the cues? Can I set that?" </p>
				<p>Only two out of all the participants pointed out that there was no option to toggle the frequency of visual/audio cues inside the application settings, which was a big feedback as the application was meant to customize every user settings according to their needs.</p>
				<p class="emp">2. "Do I have to enter each and every goal?"</p>
				<p>Every participant pointed out that typing each and every goal recommended by their therapist was taxing and suggested whether there was an option to ease that.</p>
				<p class="emp">3. "There is a lot going on in the settings. So much text!"</p>
				<p>While the settings did put the user in command for most of the tasks, the text along with the description for those settings overwhlemed the users at times. Two users also reported the secondary text being too small.</p>
				<p class="emp">4. "Should I press the green light to begin driving?"</p>
				<p>The primary action button in the dashboard threw many people offguard, who were unable to decide whether to press the 'Green light' button looking signifier or the label 'Drive Now'</p>
				<p class="emp">5. "Does the pre-driving checklist appear everytime before driving?"</p>
				<p>While the intent was to make the user aware of their inventory before driving, it became frustrating for them to view it every time before clicking on the 'Drive Now' button. Therefore, one of them suggested to allow to ability to toggle it, as well as decide for themselves what goes on that list rather than us making an exhaustive list.</p>
				<h3><span class="underline">4.3 Hi-fidelity Prototype</span></h3>
				<p>The primary aim of the hi-fidelity prototype was to address the user pain points from the paper prototype, along with allowing participants to interact with a more close to end-product experience. While the design was bare bones, it gave user the idea of what they are getting into and got us valuable feedback.</p>

				<h3><span class="underline">Key Findings</span></h3>
				<p style="margin-bottom: 1em !important">By giving the participants a scenario and a task list to work upon, we discovered some important insights from their usage and decided to assign severities to each of those findings for prioritization</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Severity 1: Two participants found ‘Positive reinforcements’ in the middle of a driving session to be distracting and suggested they appear post completion of the session along with more stress on safety and navigation.</li>
					<li>Severity 2: All participants appreciated the ability to customize every setting in the setup screens but they also found the font on the setup screens to be small for proper readability.</li>
					<li>Severity 3: One of the participants was confused whether to wait for the in-driving visual cue to disappear or to dismiss them manually.</li>
					<li>Severity 4: Two out of the three participants suggested app wide ‘Dark Mode’ for better readability but that did not prevent them from using the app.</li>

            	<h2>Design Evolution</h2>
            	<p>Be it any stage of the design process, it was essential to avoid our own biases. Every user feedback gave a new perspective on what we were designing, thereby improving it constantly and making it more close to being usable.</p>

            	<p>Making sure to not get carried away with the fidelity of the experience, the final designs addressed most of the qualms that user testing with paper and medium fidelity prototype revealed. Some of the major changes includede introducing application on-boarding and tips - to make users at ease with what they are dealing with, reducing verbosity in every function, while at the same time not deviating from our original design solution - to provide users all the provisions to customize their driving experience.</p>

            	<h2>Reflections</h2>
            	<h3><span class="underline">What Worked</span></h3>
            	<p>Being involved in a comprehensive user-centered design process for the first time, they key takeaway was to never proceed further without user feedback at every stage of the process, and that's exactly what we did. From being an idea, to a paper recreation, to low fidelity prototype and finally a usable application prototype, every design decision was informed by real users. In addition, every bit of input from our secondary stakeholders acted as a check on our design solutions. </p>
            	<h3><span class="underline">What could've been better</span></h3>
            	<p>Given the time frame of the entire project was only a quarter, the user research could've been more extensive with more time. Moreover, the specificity of the target audience made it harder, as our only means to approach TBI survivors was through Google forms and spreading the word across the campus via social media.</p>
            	<h3><span class="underline">What's next?</span></h3>
            	<p>From the moment the application idea as conceived , we always had the future prospect on our mind. One of the ideas was to link user's wearable device with our application, that mirrors the functionality from the mobile devices, but instead helps provide much more robust data about user vitals, and gives another medium to remind users - i.e haptics. In addition, after talking with therapists we discovered that having two separate login screens; one for user and one for their therapist, allowing therapist to better track patient progress and goals. </p>
