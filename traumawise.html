				<h1>Traumawise</h1>
				<p style="color: #999;">User-Centered Design</p>			
				<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
				<p>This group project was part of my User-Centered Design course at University of Washington. The project dives into the intricacies of a user-centred procees: hypothesising a design rationale, validating the hypothesis through user research, using user stories and scenarios to inform sketches and ideation, and getting user feedback for low/high fidelity prototypes.
				</p>			
				<h2 id="one">1. Design Rationale</h2>
				<p>The current state of car interfaces is increasingly digital - big bold touch screens that the user can interact with, voice command, seemless media transfer from phone to the car infotainment system. Despite these technological advancements, there have been few that address the executive functioning of the user. Returning to driving after a brain injury can be intimidating, especially when every interaction is digital. For this project we wanted to find out what are the main issues faced by TBI patients while driving, what kind of cues are they comfortable recieving, and how big of a role does a car interface play in their driving experience, which boils our design question to -</p>
				<p class="emp">"How can we support brain injury survivors as they return to driving?"</p>
				<h2 id="two">2. User Research</h2>
				<p>Before begining with user research, it was essential to establish our stakeholders. Our primary stakeholders are traumatic brain injury (TBI) survivors who are returning to driving. Our secondary stakeholders are therapists, primarily Occupational Therapists and Speech-Language Pathologists, who support patients recovering from TBIs and friends, family members, and caregivers who accompany the primary stakeholder at different stages of their tasks.

				<h3><span class="underline">2.1 Surveys</span></h3>
				<p>We created a survey with 32 questions targeting individuals with TBIs who are currently driving. The survey included the participantâ€™s demographics, medical history, challenges with driving, driving habits, and their suggestions of what could improve their driving experience. There was a combination of  short answer responses, long answer responses, and checkboxes, along with additional input for contact information so as to follow them up for interviews.</p>
